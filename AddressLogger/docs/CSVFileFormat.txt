CSV File Format:


This program generates two CSV files.


The first file is the AddressLogs file. It stores changes to the Cheat Table
values. This is the main one you will be using. It has the following column
structure:
0 = Real Time (real time) - current time of day. It is accurate but milliseconds
    are not recorded in Lua, so values recorded within a second will show the
    same time.
1 = Log Time (theoretical time) - time logged since start of script, including
    milliseconds. This is simply a calculated value so it will always DISPLAY
    the exact time theoretically, but it will not always EQUAL the correct time
    if the scipt is executing slower than your interval. Compare these values
    with the real time column to see how well the script is executing for you
    (the two times should not become misaligned unless your game pauses). It
    is formatted as "HH:MM:SS:mmm".
2+ = Addresses - Real addresses (pointers have been traced to the final
    destination), with the rows under them being the value corresponding with
    the time columns.


The second file is the AddressInformation file. It stores the descriptive data
that comes along with each address. You'll mostly use this to get the address
descriptions, since that will be important to any data visualization. It has the
following column structure:
0 = Address IDs
1 = Address Descriptions
2 = Address Types
3 = Addresses (same order as addresses in AddressLogs file)
4+ = Offset values, one offset per column


Each file has a numeric string generated after the name. For example:
AddressLogs-07202018-230910.CSV
The numbers are a date-time string, in the format of:
AddressLogs-MMDDYYYY-HHMMSS (HH is in 24 hour time)
This ensures that every saved file is unique.


All files are stored in the AddressLogger\logs directory.
