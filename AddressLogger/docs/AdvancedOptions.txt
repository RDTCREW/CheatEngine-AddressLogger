This file explains the Advanced Options available to the AddressLogger.
Your selections will persist across restarts.

1. "Only log changes when process is focused": Many games require the game
window to be in focus in order to actively run, so you can use this to avoid
logging when the game is not in focus. If your game runs in the background, you
want to work in Cheat Engine while the AddressLogger is running, or repeated
values do not matter in your logs, then you probably do not need this option.

2. "Do not create AddressInformation file": This is pretty self-explanatory.
Check out the file and if you find yourself not needing it, activate this
option.

3. "Log address on breakpoint": This is a useful feature that allows you to log
only when an address changes. When the AddressLogger detects your inputted
address to have a different value, it will log that address and any other
addresses in your table (even if they were unchanged). This option ignores your
interval setting. Make sure you input the tracked address into this field, not
the base address.

4. "Automatically attach a process on startup": Cheat Engine already has this
feature by default, but I included it here as well for accessibility. You can
have Cheat Engine open a process by default when you launch the application.
Note that your process must be opened or the option will fail.
